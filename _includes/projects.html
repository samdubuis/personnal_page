		<h3>2020</h3>

		<h5>
			<i class="fa fa-globe"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/programs/">Doctoral programs websites</a></strong>
			<br>
			- Student job where I was tasked with creating and refactoring 21 WordPress instances for the Doctoral Studies at EPFL, as previously all of them were a single website
			that was unmanaged and quite messy.

			<i class="fa fa-globe"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.fix-the-leaky-pipeline.ch">Fix-the-the-leaky-pipeline website</a></strong>
			<br>
			- Website migration from EPFL servers to Infomaniak, plus retouching and support.

		<h3>2019</h3>

				Machine Learning course at EPFL project : <i>Finding the Higgs Boson</i></a></strong>
			<br>
			- This project presents a machine learning model to
			detect the presence of the Higg’s boson in an experiment done
			by the CERN. Based on a dataset, we develop a ridge regression
			model to predict whether or not the production of a Higg’s boson
			has been done.

				Machine Learning course at EPFL project : <i>Recommender system</i></a></strong>
			<br>
			- This project presents a machine learning model that
			aims to predict item recommendations to a database of users.
			Based on the ratings of several items on a scale from 1 to
			5 (no additional information about the movies or users), we
			combine different prediction algorithms in order to guess such
			recommendations.

				Applied Data Analysis course at EPFL project : <i>Data Science for good</i></a></strong>
			<br>
			- Do you buy healthy ? Nowadays, there exists a myriad of products, examples of an ever-growing consumption regime. 
			Furthermore, the convenience of accessing such items is only a few clicks away for most of us. In this project, we ground our reasoning 
			on the consumer's point of view in today's world. Our starting point will be the Open Food Facts dataset, from which we will extract data on 
			several different food products.

		<h3>2018</h3>
		<h5>
			<i class="fa fa-github"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a name="bsc-project" href="#">BSc. Project : <i>Simulation of moiré effects for counterfeit prevention</i></a></strong>
			<br>
			- The EPFL and startup Innoview Sàrl have developed counterfeit prevention features
			for multiple purposes. The current project aims at simulating moiré effects that are
			used for thus counterfeit prevention. The project is for now confidential, and as such
			no link are available for code or documentation.
			<br>	
			- <a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/harnessing-the-moire-effect-to-make-transparent-im/">Link</a> to the article written by the EPFL that concerned the full project
			in which I participated for the simulations.

		<h5>
			<i class="fa fa-github"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://github.com/samdubuis/pdc-project">
				Principles of Communication course at EPFL mini-project : <i>Data over Sound</i></a></strong>
			<br>
			- Develop a proof of concept to show that we can exchange files "over the air" 
			between two laptops, by using the speaker of one laptop as the transmitting 
			device and the microphone of the other laptop as the receiving device in presence 
			of an <i>interfering</i> third party.

		<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
		<h5>
			<i class="fa fa-file"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://github.com/samdubuis/cv-english/tree/master/sidebar">English personnal CV written in LaTeX</a></strong>
			<br>
			- <a href="https://github.com/samdubuis/cv-english/blob/master/sidebar/main.pdf">PDF</a> 
		</h5>

		<h5>
			<i class="fa fa-cube"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://github.com/samdubuis/blender-projects">Blender repository</a></strong>
			<br>
			- This is a repository hosted on Github that contains the different simulations and renders I made throughout the year. I first started to use Blender 
			seriously for my <a href="#bsc-project">bachelor project</a> then when new update of the software came out I'd try out again and learn what was new to stay <up-to-date></up-to-date>.
