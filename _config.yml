  Recently gratuated from EPFL with a Bachelor in Communication Systems. 
  Basketball player in the second Swiss division, I’m very interested by sport, cinematography, any new technologies and anything that concerns computer science from close or far. 
  Lastly studying in the Visual Computing field, and always ready to discover and learn anything. 
  I’m starting a Master in Communication Systems and I’m looking for internship possibilities.

  This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

  Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
